# This is a task request document that concisely organizes and structures the user's request.
# Work should proceed according to this document even in the absence of direct messages from the user.
# If there are any messages from the user, their content should be taken into consideration,
# but the contents of the request document take priority.
# If there is any contradiction or mutual exclusivity between the user's message and the document,
# seek clarification from the user and revise the task request document through discussion
# to ensure the task can be carried out appropriately.
